    <td>Gun Hill Brewing Company</td>
    <td>This little brewery is tucked away in the Bronx, but definitely worth the trip if you're a lover of beer. Their stout is named The Void of Light, and is one of my personal favorites. The brewery is spacious, has board games, and serves empanadas from local restaurant, La Masa.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club</td>
    <td>A really big place with two bars and several shuffleboard courts for you to get drunk at and play. They've also got Connect 4 and oversized Jenga pieces.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Barcade</td>
    <td>Luckily, there are several Barcade chains in and out of the city. The one in Williamsburg has high ceilings and has a great vibe to it. Not to mention rows and rows of great arcade games and great seasonal beers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rock & Reilly's NYC</td>
    <td>A huge modernized pub with pretty decent food and drinks. This place is really great just for its spaciousness and look. They usually open up the doors and rooftop during the warmer nights.</td>
